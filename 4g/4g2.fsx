//For a polygone with n-> infinity the length (i.e. circumference) goes towords that of a perfect circle.
// This can be seen if one looks at a megagon (polygon with a million sides.) It is for the human eye a perfec circle.

// Suggestion - Since the circle has 1 as radius, its circumference should be pi.
// Meaning the bigger n is, the return value is closer to 2 * pi.
