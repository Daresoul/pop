// For a polygone with n-> infinity the length (i.e. circumference) goes towords that of a perfect circle. 
// This can be seen if one looks at a megagon (polygon with a million sides.) It is for the human eye a perfec circle.
// And you cant make a polygon with less than three sides/corners by their very definition (Smallest polygon has three sides in the plane.) The sides cant touch as they would collaps and become a line. If we were to did it omn a sphere you can do it.
