    \section*{Wolf in Moose's Clothing}
    \textit{"A single type of bird can be called a goose, but more is geese, but the plural of moose is not meese, and finally one wolf becomes several wolves. English is like coding. Nobody really know why we do it that way we do, but people on the internet will yell at you for getting it wrong."} \newline -Based on common saying.
