    \section*{Wolf in Moose's Clothing}
    \textit{"A single type of bird can be called a goose, but more is geese, but the plural of moose is not meese, and finally one wolf becomes several wolves. English is like coding. Nobody really know why we do it that way we do, but people on the internet will yell at you for getting it wrong."} \newline -Based on common saying.

    \section{Design}
    	We will use Jon's template, so many of the objects will remain the same, except the enviroment to which we will add all the missing behaviors and events.
    	\\
    	To move the animals, we pick a vector out of 8('cause there are only 8 directions), check if it's a valid move('cause  the animal could be at the edges of the board) and change the animals' position with the vector.
    	\\
    	To make the order of animals random, we first look at the wolf list and create a tuple list, where the first element will contain their symbol "w" and the second element will contain the index of the wolves. The same is done to the moose list and we will then join the two lists and shuffle. After the tuple list is shuffled, we will use it to determined who's turn it is.
    	\\
    	To shuffle the tuple list, we will use a function with a for loop that will pick a random index, remove the element from the tuple list and also put it in a new list. The function should return the new list as a shuffled tuple list.
    	\\
    	To run the simulation, we will use an object with a while loop.
    \subsection{Two-lists makes a board}
    \subsection{Animals}
    	Animals are objects with properties symbol, position, reproduction. Symbol contains a character, either 'm', 'w' or ' ', and is used to identify the animal. Position contains either Some(int * int) or None, and is the position of the board. Reproduction contains an integer and is used to indicate when it is time to reproduce.
    	\\
    	Animals also has behaviours called updateReproduction() and resetReproduction(). The former reduces the reproduction property by 1, and the latter resets it to the start value.
    \subsubsection{Moose}
    	Moose inherits Animals, but has an additional method, tick(), which returns a Moose object or None.
    \subsubsection{Wolf}    
		Wolf inherits Animals, but has one more attribute hunger and many additional methods, updateHunger(), resetHunger() and tick(). Hunger is used to tell when it's time to hunt or die. updateHunger() reduces the hunger by 1 and changes position to None if hunger is 0. resetHunger() resets hunger to start value. tick() returns either a wolf object or None. 
    \section{Implementation}
		\lstset{language=FSharp}

		\begin{lstlisting}
/// An animal is a base class. It has a position and a reproduction counter.
type animal (symb : symbol, repLen : int) =
  let mutable _reproduction = rnd.Next(1,repLen)
  let mutable _pos : position option = None
  let _symbol : symbol = symb

  member this.symbol = _symbol
  member this.position
    with get () = _pos
    and set aPos = _pos <- aPos
  member this.reproduction = _reproduction
  member this.updateReproduction () =
    _reproduction <- _reproduction - 1
  member this.resetReproduction () =
    _reproduction <- repLen

  override this.ToString () =
    string this.symbol
