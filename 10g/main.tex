    \section*{Wolf in Moose's Clothing}
    \textit{"A single type of bird can be called a goose, but more is geese, but the plural of moose is not meese, and finally one wolf becomes several wolves. English is like coding. Nobody really know why we do it that way we do, but people on the internet will yell at you for getting it wrong."} \newline -Based on common saying.

    \section{Design}
    	We use Jon's template.
    	\\
    	To make the order of animals random, we first look at the wolf list and create a tuple list, where the first element will contain their symbol "w" and the second element will contain the index of the wolves. The same is done to the moose list and we will then join the two lists and shuffle. After the tuple list is shuffled, we will use it to determined who's turn it is.
    	\\
    	To shuffle the tuple list, we will use a function with a for loop that will pick a random index, remove the element from the tuple list and also put it in a new list. The function should return the new list as a shuffled tuple list.

/// An animal is a base class. It has a position and a reproduction counter.
type animal (symb : symbol, repLen : int) =
  let mutable _reproduction = rnd.Next(1,repLen)
  let mutable _pos : position option = None
  let _symbol : symbol = symb

  member this.position
    with get () = _pos
    and set aPos = _pos <- aPos

  member this.updateReproduction () =
    _reproduction <- _reproduction - 1
  member this.resetReproduction () =
    _reproduction <- repLen

  override this.ToString () =
